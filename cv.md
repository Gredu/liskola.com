Hi! I am Jesse. I have been dancing as long as I remember. Movies were also my passion since I was a kid. At the age of 24 my life started to enfold professonaly around the Finnish film industry. Iâ€™ve been participated in several productions: movies and short movies, music videos, commercials, TV-series and theaters.

My main profession is acting, but I believe that understanding every aspect of production chain is vital. Everyone has an important role, every work is important. Understanding others and respect of their work is important to teamwork. No one makes movies alone. This mindset has given me experience in almost every field in movie industry, not only in acting.

 A good place to see my work is [facebook]() and [IMDB]().
