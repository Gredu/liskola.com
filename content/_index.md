Hi! I am Jesse. I have been dancing as long as I remember. Movies were also my passion since I was a kid. At the age of 24, my life started focusing professionally around the Finnish film industry. I have participated in several productions, movies and short films, music videos, commercials, television series and theater productions.

My main profession is acting, but I believe that understanding every aspect of media production is vital. Each position has a important role. Understanding others and respecting their work is important for the whole team, for no one makes movies alone. This mindset has given me a vast experience in almost every field in the many media industries around, not only in acting.

 A good place to see my work is [CV](https://resume.io/r/D57VBpBZh) and [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4371508/). My activities and personal life can be seen in [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jesse.liskola).
